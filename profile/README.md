## üöÄ Overview

MiJournal is a macOS journaling app crafted for anyone who wants to capture thoughts, memories, and moments in a rich and meaningful way. Whether you're recording daily reflections, tracking mood and habits, or simply putting pen to digital paper, this app offers both structure and flexibility.  

Every journal entry can include text, photos, audio recordings, locations, and even context tags, so your journal becomes more than just writing‚Äîit becomes a living, searchable memory book. You can browse entries by date, search by keyword or tag, revisit places you‚Äôve been via map view, and look back on how you felt, where you were, or what you were doing. It supports organizing journals ‚Äî for example, separate ones for travel, personal growth, work, creativity ‚Äî so that different aspects of your life stay organized and distinct.

MiJournal also helps you build a journaling habit: reminders, streak tracking, and daily journal prompts encourage consistency. You can personalize the experience with different themes, layout options like full-screen mode, dark mode, or minimalist view so you‚Äôre not distracted when you reflect. Because your journal is stored locally (with optional backup if you prefer), you have privacy and control over your memories.
